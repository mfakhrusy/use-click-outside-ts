Hello!

This is a project to demonstrate a custom hook about checking whether a click event is performed outside of a specified element or not.

I wrote a blog post explaining about this project here: https://blog.fakhrusy.com/click-outside-hook-ts

To run the project, we need to install some npm dependencies:

After that, we need to install npm dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Then, run the local server

```sh
yarn dev
```

Thank you for having me
